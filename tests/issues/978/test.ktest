KEYSWITCH A 0 0

# ==============================================================================
# This testcase shouldn't generate any HID reports. The sketch includes a plugin
# that produces `Key_X` if the key at (0,0) is idle, so if the virtual device is
# calling `handleKeyswitchEvent()` when `key_state` has neither `IS_PRESSED` nor
# `WAS_PRESSED` bits set, it will fail.
